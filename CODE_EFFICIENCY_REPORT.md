## Detailed Findings

### Inefficiency #1: Cache Cleanup Creates Unnecessary Intermediate List ⚠️ HIGH IMPACT

**Location**: `mcp_server/rag_engine.py:467-480`

**Current Code**:
```python
def _clean_cache(self) -> None:
    """Remove expired cache entries.

    Iterates through cache and deletes entries that have exceeded
    the TTL threshold.
    """
    current_time = time.time()
    expired_keys = [
        key
        for key, (_, timestamp) in self._query_cache.items()
        if current_time - timestamp > self.cache_ttl_seconds
    ]
    for key in expired_keys:
        del self._query_cache[key]
```

**Issue**:
The method performs a two-pass operation:
1. First pass: Create list of expired keys using list comprehension
2. Second pass: Iterate through the list to delete each key

This creates an unnecessary intermediate list and requires two iterations over the data.

**Recommended Fix**:
```python
def _clean_cache(self) -> None:
    """Remove expired cache entries.

    Filters cache to retain only non-expired entries using dict comprehension
    for improved performance (avoids intermediate list creation).
    """
    current_time = time.time()
    self._query_cache = {
        key: value
        for key, value in self._query_cache.items()
        if current_time - value[1] <= self.cache_ttl_seconds
    }
```

**Benefits**:
- Single pass through the cache instead of two
- No intermediate list allocation
- More Pythonic and readable
- O(n) space complexity reduced (no temporary list)

**Impact**: HIGH - This method is called in the hot path of RAG query operations (triggered when cache exceeds 100 entries at line 464).

**Status**: ✅ FIXED in this PR

### Inefficiency #2: Inefficient Type Checking in Token Sum 🔶 MEDIUM IMPACT

**Location**: `mcp_server/rag_engine.py:382-385`

**Current Code**:
```python
total_tokens = sum(
    int(c["token_count"]) if isinstance(c["token_count"], (int, str)) else 0
    for c in chunks
)
```

**Issue**:
- Performs type checking for every chunk
- Converts int to int unnecessarily (when already int)
- Inefficient handling if token_count could be other types

**Recommended Fix**:
```python
total_tokens = sum(
    int(c["token_count"]) if isinstance(c["token_count"], str) else c.get("token_count", 0)
    for c in chunks
)
```

Or better yet, ensure token_count is always an int in the data model:
```python
total_tokens = sum(c.get("token_count", 0) for c in chunks)
```

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates unnecessary type conversion for ints
- Cleaner logic
- Faster execution per iteration

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Called once per search query, operates on all returned chunks

---

### Inefficiency #3: Manual Hash Character Counting 🔶 MEDIUM IMPACT

**Location**: 
- `mcp_server/chunker.py:56-68` (in `parse_markdown_headers`)
- `mcp_server/chunker.py:457-462` (in `_extract_header_hierarchy`)

**Current Code** (repeated pattern):
```python
hash_count = 0
for char in stripped:
    if char == "#":
        hash_count += 1
    else:
        break
```

**Issue**:
Manual iteration to count leading '#' characters when Python has built-in string methods for this.

**Recommended Fix**:
```python
hash_count = len(stripped) - len(stripped.lstrip('#'))
```

**Benefits**:
- Uses optimized built-in string methods
- One-liner instead of loop
- More Pythonic
- Potentially faster (C-level implementation)

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Called for every line in every markdown file during chunking operations

---

### Inefficiency #4: Repeated Substring Search in Topic Analysis 🔶 MEDIUM IMPACT

**Location**: `mcp_server/chunker.py:365-369`

**Current Code**:
```python
for topic, indicators in topic_indicators.items():
    # Check if multiple indicators present (stronger signal)
    indicator_count = sum(1 for ind in indicators if ind in content_lower)
    if indicator_count > 0:
        tags.append(topic)
```

**Issue**:
- Performs substring search (`in` operator) multiple times for each topic
- With 10 topics and ~5 indicators each, this does 50 substring searches per chunk
- Content is already lowercased but search happens for every indicator

**Recommended Fix**:
Pre-compute a set of words in content for O(1) lookup:
```python
content_words = set(content_lower.split())
for topic, indicators in topic_indicators.items():
    indicator_count = sum(1 for ind in indicators if ind in content_lower or ind in content_words)
    if indicator_count > 0:
        tags.append(topic)
```

Or use regex for multi-pattern matching if the overhead is justified.

**Benefits**:
- Reduced substring search complexity for word-based indicators
- More efficient for large content chunks

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Called once per chunk during indexing, affects build time

### Inefficiency #5: Unnecessary List Creation for Sequentiality Check 🔶 MEDIUM IMPACT

**Location**: `mcp_server/state_manager.py:369-376`

**Current Code**:
```python
if state.completed_phases:
    sorted_phases = sorted(state.completed_phases)
    expected = list(range(1, len(sorted_phases) + 1))
    if sorted_phases != expected:
        issues.append(
            f"Completed phases not sequential: {state.completed_phases}"
        )
```

**Issue**:
- Creates a sorted copy of the list
- Creates an expected list with range()
- Both allocations are unnecessary

**Recommended Fix**:
```python
if state.completed_phases:
    sorted_phases = sorted(state.completed_phases)
    # Check if sequential by comparing with range
    if sorted_phases != list(range(sorted_phases[0], sorted_phases[-1] + 1)):
        issues.append(
            f"Completed phases not sequential: {state.completed_phases}"
        )
```

Or even better:
```python
if state.completed_phases:
    sorted_phases = sorted(state.completed_phases)
    # Check each pair is consecutive
    is_sequential = all(
        sorted_phases[i] + 1 == sorted_phases[i + 1]
        for i in range(len(sorted_phases) - 1)
    ) and sorted_phases[0] == 1
    if not is_sequential:
        issues.append(
            f"Completed phases not sequential: {state.completed_phases}"
        )
```

**Benefits**:
- Avoids creating expected list
- More efficient for large phase lists
- Clearer intent

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Called during state validation, affects workflow operations

### Inefficiency #6: Repeated List Slicing in Checkpoint Parsing 🔷 LOW IMPACT

**Location**: `mcp_server/workflow_engine.py:129-143` (in `_parse_checkpoint_requirements`)

**Current Code**:
```python
for i, line in enumerate(lines):
    # Detect evidence requirement patterns dynamically
    if self._is_evidence_requirement(line):
        field_name = self._extract_field_name(line)
        if field_name and field_name != "unknown_field":
            context_lines = (
                lines[i : i + 3] if i + 3 < len(lines) else lines[i:]
            )
            # ... use context_lines
```

**Issue**:
- Creates new list slices for each requirement found
- Slice operation allocates new memory

**Recommended Fix**:
Pass indices instead of slices, or reuse view if possible:
```python
for i, line in enumerate(lines):
    if self._is_evidence_requirement(line):
        field_name = self._extract_field_name(line)
        if field_name and field_name != "unknown_field":
            # Pass indices instead of creating slice
            end_idx = min(i + 3, len(lines))
            field_type = self._infer_field_type(line, lines, i, end_idx)
            validator = self._extract_validator(line, lines, i, end_idx)
```

Then update method signatures to accept indices.

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates list slice allocations
- More memory efficient

**Impact**: LOW - Called during workflow initialization (not in hot path)

### Inefficiency #7: Using len() > 0 Instead of Truthiness 🔷 LOW IMPACT

**Location**: `mcp_server/framework_generator.py:477-480`

**Current Code**:
```python
if len(framework.files) > 0:
    report["command_usage"] = int(
        (files_with_commands / len(framework.files)) * 100
    )
```

**Issue**:
- `len() > 0` is less Pythonic than checking truthiness
- Minor performance overhead (function call)

**Recommended Fix**:
```python
if framework.files:
    report["command_usage"] = int(
        (files_with_commands / len(framework.files)) * 100
    )
```

**Benefits**:
- More Pythonic
- Slightly faster (no function call)
- Cleaner code

**Impact**: LOW - Called during framework validation (infrequent operation)

---

### Inefficiency #8: Repeated File Extension Checks 🔷 LOW IMPACT

**Location**: `mcp_server/monitoring/watcher.py:82-83, 98-99, 112-113`

**Current Code** (repeated pattern in 3 methods):
```python
if not (event.src_path.endswith(".md") or event.src_path.endswith(".json")):
    return
```

**Issue**:
- Calls `endswith()` twice per event
- Repeated pattern across multiple methods

**Recommended Fix**:
Extract to a helper method or use a tuple:
```python
WATCHED_EXTENSIONS = ('.md', '.json')

# In each method:
if not event.src_path.endswith(WATCHED_EXTENSIONS):
    return
```

Note: `str.endswith()` accepts a tuple of suffixes.

**Benefits**:
- Single function call instead of two
- Easier to maintain (centralized list)
- Cleaner code

**Impact**: LOW - File watcher events are relatively infrequent
