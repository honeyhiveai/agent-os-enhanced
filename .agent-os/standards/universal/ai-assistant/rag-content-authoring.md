# RAG-Optimized Content Authoring

**Standard for writing content that is discoverable through semantic search.**

---

## üéØ Purpose

This standard defines how to author content (standards, workflows, usage docs) that AI agents can discover through natural language RAG queries. Content must be structured so the chunking algorithm and ranking system return relevant information when agents query naturally.

**Core Principle**: RAG search is the interface. Content not discoverable through natural queries does not exist to AI agents.

---

## üö® The Fundamental Problem

**What happens when content isn't RAG-optimized:**

```
Agent queries: "how do I execute a specification?"
RAG returns: Irrelevant chunks, or nothing
Agent behavior: Guesses, hallucinates, or breaks patterns

Result: Agent never learns the correct approach
```

**What happens when content IS RAG-optimized:**

```
Agent queries: "how do I execute a specification?"
RAG returns: Workflow documentation with exact guidance
Agent behavior: Follows documented patterns

Result: Agent works correctly, system reinforces itself
```

---

## üìã RAG Optimization Principles

### Principle 1: Write for Natural Queries, Not Readers

**Wrong mindset**: "I'm writing documentation for humans to read"

**Right mindset**: "I'm writing content that answers natural language questions"

**Example:**

**Bad** (not discoverable):
```markdown
## Workflow Usage

To use workflows, call the start function.
```

**Good** (discoverable):
```markdown
## How to Execute a Specification (Workflow Usage)

**When user says "execute spec" or "implement the spec":**

Use the spec_execution_v1 workflow:
```python
start_workflow("spec_execution_v1", target, options={"spec_path": "..."})
```

**Common scenarios:**
- User wants to implement a completed spec
- You have spec files in .agent-os/specs/
- Need systematic phase-by-phase implementation
```

**Why it's good:**
- Header includes natural query: "how to execute a specification"
- Contains exact phrases agents will search: "execute spec", "implement the spec"
- Shows concrete scenario: "when user says"
- High keyword density for "spec", "execute", "workflow"

---

### Principle 2: Include "Query Hooks"

**Query hooks** are natural language phrases that match how agents think about problems.

**Include these in every standard:**

```markdown
## Common Questions This Answers

- "How do I [task]?"
- "User wants me to [action]"
- "When should I use [feature]?"
- "What workflow for [scenario]?"
```

**Example:**

```markdown
## When to Use Workflows (Query Hooks)

**Questions this answers:**
- "Should I use a workflow for this task?"
- "User wants me to execute a spec - what do I do?"
- "How do I handle complex multi-phase work?"
- "What's the difference between workflows and ad-hoc coding?"

**Scenarios where you need workflows:**
- User says "execute this spec"
- Task has >3 phases or >5 days of work
- Need validation gates between phases
- Want state persistence and resumability
```

This chunk will now return for ANY of those natural queries!

---

### Principle 3: Optimize Headers for Chunking

The chunker splits on `##` and `###` headers. Each chunk should be semantically complete and keyword-rich.

**Chunk size target**: 100-500 tokens (~400-2000 characters)

**Bad headers** (not descriptive):
```markdown
## Usage
## Examples  
## Notes
```

**Good headers** (keyword-rich, specific):
```markdown
## How to Execute Specifications (Workflow Usage)
## Spec Execution Workflow Examples
## Common Spec Execution Scenarios and Solutions
```

**Why:**
- Headers become `section_header` metadata in chunks
- Headers appear in search results
- Headers should contain keywords agents will search for

---

### Principle 4: Front-Load Critical Information

**Problem**: 750-line document gets split into 40 chunks. Only 1 chunk contains title keywords.

**Solution**: Add a "TL;DR" or "Quick Reference" section at the top with high keyword density.

**Template:**

```markdown
# [Topic] - Complete Guide

## üö® [Topic] Quick Reference

**Critical information for [use case]:**

1. **[Key Point 1]** - [One sentence]
2. **[Key Point 2]** - [One sentence]  
3. **[Key Point 3]** - [One sentence]

**Keywords for search**: [topic], [synonym], [related term], [common query phrase]

**When to use**: [Common scenarios as natural language]

**Read complete guide below** for detailed patterns and examples.

---

[Rest of detailed content...]
```

**Why this works:**
- Creates one high-density chunk with all critical info
- Contains topic keywords multiple times (high relevance)
- Returns as first result for topic queries
- Includes explicit "search keywords" for ranking

---

### Principle 5: Avoid Documentation Drift - Link to Source of Truth

**Problem**: Hardcoding instructions in multiple places creates drift when things change.

**Example of drift:**

```markdown
# File: standards/ai-assistant/AGENT-OS-ORIENTATION.md
When user says "execute spec": start_workflow("spec_execution_v1", ...)

# File: usage/creating-specs.md  
To execute specs, use start_workflow("spec_execution_v1", ...)

# File: workflows/spec_execution_v1/README.md
[Actual current syntax that's different]

Result: Agent gets conflicting information!
```

**Solution: Single Source of Truth + Dynamic Discovery**

**In orientation file:**
```markdown
## How to Discover What to Do

When uncertain ‚Üí Query for guidance:
- "how to execute a specification?"
- "user wants to implement spec"
- "what workflow for spec execution?"

The RAG will return current documentation from the workflow itself.

**Don't memorize commands. Query dynamically.**
```

**In workflow documentation:**
```markdown
## How to Use spec_execution_v1 Workflow

[Current, maintained instructions]
```

**Result**: Only ONE place to maintain, no drift possible.

---

### Principle 6: Test Discoverability with Natural Queries

After writing content, TEST if it's discoverable:

```python
# Test if agents can find your content
search_standards("how to execute a specification")
# Should return your workflow documentation

search_standards("user wants to implement a spec")
# Should return same workflow documentation

search_standards("when should I use workflows")
# Should return workflow decision guidance
```

**If your content doesn't return**: 
- Add more natural language query hooks
- Increase keyword density in critical sections
- Front-load a TL;DR section
- Simplify headers to include keywords

---

## ‚úÖ RAG-Optimized Content Checklist

When authoring any standard, workflow, or usage doc:

- [ ] Headers contain keywords agents will search for
- [ ] Document includes "query hooks" (natural language questions it answers)
- [ ] Critical information front-loaded in TL;DR section
- [ ] Keywords appear naturally throughout content (not keyword stuffing)
- [ ] Content teaches querying patterns, not hardcoded instructions
- [ ] Links to source of truth instead of duplicating information
- [ ] Tested with natural language queries (verified it returns)
- [ ] Chunks are 100-500 tokens (appropriate for semantic search)
- [ ] Each section is semantically complete (can stand alone)

---

## üìö Examples

### Example 1: Bad vs Good Workflow Documentation

**‚ùå Bad** (not discoverable):
```markdown
# spec_execution_v1

## Usage

Call the workflow with the spec path.

## Options

- spec_path: path to spec
```

**‚úÖ Good** (discoverable):
```markdown
# Specification Execution Workflow (spec_execution_v1)

## How to Execute a Specification (When User Says "Implement Spec")

**Common scenarios:**
- User says "execute this spec" or "implement the spec"
- You have a complete spec in .agent-os/specs/
- Need systematic phase-by-phase implementation

**How to start:**

```python
start_workflow(
    workflow_type="spec_execution_v1",
    target_file="feature-name",
    options={"spec_path": ".agent-os/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-name"}
)
```

**What this workflow does:**
- Parses tasks from spec's tasks.md
- Executes phase-by-phase with validation gates
- Provides resumability if interrupted
- Enforces quality standards at each phase

**When NOT to use:**
- Small tasks (<30 minutes)
- Ad-hoc code changes
- Simple bug fixes

**Questions this answers:**
- "How do I execute a specification?"
- "User wants me to implement a spec - what do I do?"
- "What workflow for spec execution?"
```

---

### Example 2: Bad vs Good Orientation Content

**‚ùå Bad** (hardcoded, will drift):
```markdown
## Workflows

To execute specs, run:
start_workflow("spec_execution_v1", target, options={"spec_path": "..."})

For test generation, run:
start_workflow("test_generation_v3", target, options={...})
```

**‚úÖ Good** (teaches discovery, no drift):
```markdown
## How to Discover What Workflow to Use

**You discover workflows dynamically through querying:**

When uncertain about what workflow to use:
‚Üí search_standards("what workflow for [your task]?")

Examples:
- "what workflow for executing a spec?"
- "what workflow for test generation?"
- "should I use a workflow for this task?"

The RAG will return current workflow documentation with usage instructions.

**Pattern: Query ‚Üí Discover ‚Üí Act**

Don't memorize workflow commands. Query dynamically to get current, maintained instructions.
```

---

## üîÑ Testing and Iteration

### Test Suite for Discoverability

Create tests that verify critical content is discoverable:

```python
def test_spec_execution_discoverable():
    """Verify agents can discover how to execute specs."""
    queries = [
        "how do I execute a specification?",
        "user wants me to implement a spec",
        "what workflow for spec execution?",
    ]
    
    for query in queries:
        results = search_standards(query, n_results=5)
        
        # Should return workflow documentation
        assert any("spec_execution_v1" in chunk.content 
                   for chunk in results.chunks)
        
        # Should include usage instructions  
        assert any("start_workflow" in chunk.content 
                   for chunk in results.chunks)
```

### Iteration Process

1. **Write content** using principles above
2. **Test queries** - Does it return for natural questions?
3. **Check ranking** - Is it in top 3 results?
4. **Refine** - Add query hooks, increase keyword density
5. **Retest** - Verify improvements
6. **Ship** - Content is now discoverable

## üö´ Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Keyword Stuffing

**Wrong:**
```markdown
## Agent OS Orientation Guide Agent OS Orientation Agent OS

Agent OS orientation guide for Agent OS agents to learn Agent OS...
```

**Right:**
Use keywords naturally in context, not repetitively.

---

### Anti-Pattern 2: Circular References

**Wrong:**
```markdown
## Orientation

Query search_standards("Agent OS orientation guide") to load orientation.
```

**Right:**
```markdown
## Orientation Quick Reference

[Actual critical information here]

For complete 750-line guide, continue reading below.
```

---

### Anti-Pattern 3: Burying Critical Info

**Wrong:**
```markdown
# Complete Guide (750 lines)

## Background
[50 lines of history]

## Architecture  
[100 lines of design]

## Usage (finally!)
[Critical info at line 500]
```

**Right:**
```markdown
# Complete Guide

## Quick Reference (Critical Info)
[All critical info in first 50 lines]

## Detailed Background
[Additional context for those who need it]
```

---

## üìû Questions?

**How do I test if my content is discoverable?**
‚Üí Use search_standards() with natural queries you expect agents to use

**How do I know what queries agents will use?**
‚Üí Think about how you would ask the question naturally. Include those phrases as query hooks.

**Should I optimize every sentence for RAG?**
‚Üí No. Focus on headers, first sections, and query hooks. Rest can be natural prose.

**What if content needs to be in multiple places?**
‚Üí Link to single source of truth. Don't duplicate.

**Remember**: If agents can't find it through natural queries, it doesn't exist. Write for discovery, not for reading.
