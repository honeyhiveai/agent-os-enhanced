#### Task 6.1: Create Pre-Commit Validation Hooks

**Description:** Set up local pre-commit hooks to catch documentation quality issues BEFORE they reach CI/CD. Provides immediate feedback to developers.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] File created: `scripts/pre-commit/validate-docs.sh` (or integrate into existing pre-commit infrastructure)

     - Run `python scripts/validate-divio-compliance.py` on changed files only
     - Fail commit if compliance <80% (warning threshold)
  2. **Link Validation:**
     - Run `python scripts/validate-links.py --skip-external` on changed files
     - Fail commit if broken internal links found
  3. **Build Check (Optional):**
     - Optional full build check (can be slow)
     - Enabled via environment variable: `DOCS_FULL_BUILD=1`

     - Upload compliance report as artifact
  2. **Link Validation:**
     - Run `scripts/validate-links.py` (including external URLs)
     - Fail if broken links found
     - Upload link validation report as artifact
  3. **Build Check:**
     - Run `npm run build` in docs/

- [ ] Workflow uses caching for node_modules
- [ ] Workflow completes in <5 minutes
- [ ] Status checks required for PR merge
- [ ] Deploy job (on push to main):
  - Deploy to GitHub Pages after all checks pass
- [ ] Documentation explains workflow and how to interpret failures

**Time Estimate:** 1.5-2 hours

**Dependencies:** Task 6.1 complete (pre-commit hooks exist), Phase 1-5 complete (all content finalized)

**Rationale:** CI/CD is BACKSTOP for pre-commit hooks. Catches issues from developers who skip hooks, validates external links (slow, not suitable for pre-commit), generates reports for auditing.

#### Task 6.3: Generate Migration Report

**Description:** Document the documentation restructure results, metrics, and migration summary.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] File created: `docs/MIGRATION-REPORT.md` (or in spec directory)
- [ ] Report includes:
  - **Summary:** What was changed, why, and outcome
  - **Metrics:**
    - Before: Divio compliance score (from baseline)
    - After: Divio compliance score (target â‰¥90%)
    - Before: Broken links count
    - After: Broken links count (0)
    - Before: Tutorial coverage (0%)
    - After: Tutorial coverage (2 tutorials)
    - Before: How-to coverage (X guides)
    - After: How-to coverage (6 guides)
    - Search response time
  - **Changes:**
    - Directory structure reorganization
    - Files moved/created/refactored
    - New components (type badges, validation scripts)
    - CI/CD automation added
  - **Testing Results:**
    - Tutorial user testing (success rate, time taken)
    - Compliance validation results
    - Link validation results
  - **Next Steps:**
    - Ongoing maintenance
    - Future enhancements (if any out-of-scope items become in-scope)
- [ ] Report formatted in markdown
- [ ] Report includes before/after screenshots
- [ ] Report references spec documents for full context

**Time Estimate:** 1-1.5 hours

**Dependencies:** Phase 1-5 complete (all work done, metrics available)

### Phase 6 Validation Gate

ðŸ›‘ **Phase 6 Completion Checkpoint:**

Before marking project complete:
- [ ] Pre-commit validation hooks installed and working
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline deployed and passing
- [ ] Migration report generated
- [ ] All validation passing:
  - Divio compliance â‰¥90%
  - 0 broken links
  - Build succeeds
- [ ] Documentation complete and deployed

**Evidence Required:**
- Pre-commit hook execution log showing validation runs
- GitHub Actions workflow run showing all checks passing
- Migration report with before/after metrics
- Live documentation URL with working search and type badges

- [ ] Divio compliance â‰¥90% overall
- [ ] Documentation builds successfully
- [ ] Ready for production deployment

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Tutorial Success Rate <95%

**Mitigation:**
- Iterate based on user testing feedback
- Simplify steps if users struggle
- Add screenshots for visual guidance
- Test with diverse user backgrounds

### Risk 2: Divio Compliance <90%

**Mitigation:**
- Run validation early and often
- Use validation script feedback to guide refactoring
- Refer to Divio documentation for compliance patterns
- Accept that some docs may be 85-90% (not all docs need 100%)

### Risk 3: Migration Takes Longer Than Estimated

**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize critical content first (tutorials, how-to guides)
- Reference docs can be enhanced incrementally
- Automate repetitive tasks (link updates, frontmatter addition)
- Accept MVP and iterate

### Risk 4: Search Performance <500ms

**Mitigation:**
- Optimize Algolia index settings
- Reduce index size if needed
- Use contextual search and faceting
- Fallback to client-side search if Algolia fails

---

## Notes

- **This is a reorganization and enhancement, not a greenfield creation.** Many docs already exist and need refactoring, not rewriting from scratch.
- **Quality over speed:** Tutorial success rate and Divio compliance are non-negotiable. Take time to test and iterate.
- **User-centric:** Test with real users early and often. Don't assume instructions are clear until users validate them.
- **Automate validation:** CI/CD automation ensures compliance doesn't degrade over time.
