## Type 1: System Prompt (Agent Init)

### Definition
The **system prompt** defines the AI's identity, role, constraints, and operational rules. It's sent with **every single API call** for that agent.

### Characteristics

| Property | Value | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Frequency** | Every API call | $$$ High cost |
| **Persistence** | Entire session | Always present |
| **Size** | 500-4000 tokens | Fixed overhead |
| **Purpose** | Identity & rules | Behavior shaping |
| **Optimization Priority** | **HIGH** | Cost multiplies |

### Example: Workflow Executor Persona

**Current Size**: 554 lines, ~3,500 tokens

**Sent on every call**:
```
API Call 1: System (3,500) + User (100) + RAG (2,000) = 5,600 tokens
API Call 2: System (3,500) + User (150) + RAG (1,500) = 5,150 tokens
API Call 3: System (3,500) + User (200) + RAG (2,500) = 6,200 tokens
...
API Call 24: System (3,500) + User (100) + RAG (1,000) = 4,600 tokens

TOTAL SYSTEM PROMPT TOKENS: 3,500 × 24 = 84,000 tokens
```

### Cost Implications

**Per Workflow Execution** (8 phases, ~24 API calls):

| Prompt Size | Tokens/Call | Total Tokens | Cost (Claude 3.5) |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Large (3.5K) | 3,500 | 84,000 | $0.252 |
| Medium (1.5K) | 1,500 | 36,000 | $0.108 |
| Optimized (800) | 800 | 19,200 | $0.058 |
| Minimal (500) | 500 | 12,000 | $0.036 |

**Annual Cost** (1000 workflows):

| Prompt Size | Annual Cost | Savings vs Large |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| Large (3.5K) | $252 | Baseline |
| Medium (1.5K) | $108 | $144 (57%) |
| Optimized (800) | $58 | $194 (77%) |
| Minimal (500) | $36 | $216 (86%) |

### Optimization Strategy

**❌ Don't optimize for attention quality** (system prompts are handled well)  
**✅ Optimize for token count** (cost is the real issue)

**Current: Verbose Natural Language** (3,500 tokens)
```markdown
# IDENTITY: Workflow Executor Sub-Agent

You are a **Workflow Executor**, operating in **CONSUMPTION-ONLY MODE**.

## Your Core Identity

**Who you are:**
- A specialized AI agent that executes phase-gated workflows with 100% fidelity
- Expert at following structured processes without shortcuts
- Methodical, systematic, evidence-driven

**What makes you different:**
- You operate in a FRESH CONTEXT with NO memory of workflow authorship
- You CANNOT read workflow files directly
- You MUST use MCP tools for ALL workflow access
...
(continues for 550 more lines)
```

**Optimized: Command Language + Structured** (800 tokens)
```markdown
# IDENTITY: Workflow Executor (Consumption-Only)

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Context Isolation: Fresh session, zero authorship memory
2. MCP-Only: Use tools (start_workflow, get_current_phase, complete_phase)
3. Commands Binding: 🛑=execute, ⚠️=read, 🎯=navigate, 📊=quantify
4. Evidence Required: Numbers, counts, names (never vague)
5. Gates Enforced: Pass validation before advance

🛑 BINDING CONTRACT (acknowledge before start):
"I will: follow phases 0-N in order, execute 🛑 commands, 
provide 📊 evidence, use MCP only, report violations"

VIOLATIONS (self-detect):
🚨 Phase skip → STOP, return to correct phase
🚨 Direct file → STOP, use get_current_phase()
🚨 Vague evidence → STOP, quantify
🚨 Ignore command → STOP, execute now

PROTOCOL:
1. start_workflow() → Phase 0 + contract
2. Acknowledge contract (exact)
3. Loop phases:
   - get_current_phase() → current only
   - Execute 🛑, read ⚠️
   - Gather 📊 evidence
   - complete_phase() → validate
```

**Reduction**: 3,500 → 800 tokens = **77% savings**

---

## Type 2: User Prompt (Current Request)

### Definition
The **user prompt** is the specific request or query the user is making right now. This is what the user types or what your code sends as the immediate task.

### Characteristics

| Property | Value | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Frequency** | Once per request | $ Moderate cost |
| **Persistence** | Single call | Then in history |
| **Size** | 50-500 tokens | Variable |
| **Purpose** | Specific task | Action trigger |
| **Optimization Priority** | **LOW** | User controls it |

### Examples

**Simple User Prompt** (50 tokens):
```
Analyze src/auth.py for concurrency issues
```

**Complex User Prompt** (500 tokens):
```
Analyze the authentication service in src/auth.py for potential concurrency issues.
Focus on:
- Race conditions in token generation
- Thread-safety of the session store
- Lock contention in the cache layer

Provide:
- Severity assessment
- Specific line numbers
- Recommended fixes with code examples
- Estimated fix time

Context: This is a high-traffic API serving 10K req/sec with Redis-backed sessions.
```

**Workflow Execution Prompt** (100 tokens):
```
Execute test generation workflow for src/payment.py with:
- Type: unit tests
- Framework: pytest
- Coverage target: 90%
```

### Cost Implications

User prompts are **one-time per request**, so token count matters less than system prompts.

**Cost**: 100 tokens × $0.003/1K = $0.0003 (negligible)

### No Optimization Needed

User prompts are:
- Controlled by the user
- One-time cost (not multiplied)
- Already concise (typically)

Focus optimization efforts elsewhere.

---

## Type 3: Conversation History (Context)

### Definition
The **conversation history** is the accumulation of all previous user prompts and assistant responses in the current session.

### Characteristics

| Property | Value | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Frequency** | Every call (grows) | $$ Accumulating cost |
| **Persistence** | Entire session | Until reset |
| **Size** | 0-100K+ tokens | Can explode |
| **Purpose** | Continuity | Context for AI |
| **Optimization Priority** | **MEDIUM** | Managed automatically |

### Growth Pattern

```
Call 1: System (800) + User (100) + History (0) = 900 tokens
Call 2: System (800) + User (150) + History (200) = 1,150 tokens
Call 3: System (800) + User (200) + History (550) = 1,550 tokens
Call 4: System (800) + User (100) + History (950) = 1,850 tokens
...
Call 20: System (800) + User (100) + History (15,000) = 15,900 tokens
```

**Problem**: History grows linearly → token costs grow quadratically

### Cost Implications

**Long Conversation** (20 messages):

| System | User Avg | History Total | Total Input | Cost |
|--------|----------|---------------|-------------|------|
| 800 | 150 | 15,000 | 15,950 | $0.048 |
| 3,500 | 150 | 15,000 | 18,650 | $0.056 |

**Takeaway**: Large system prompts amplify history cost (but history is bigger impact)

### Optimization Strategy

**Strategy 1: Context Window Management** (Automatic)
- LLM providers automatically truncate old messages
- Keep recent N messages
- Summarize older context

**Strategy 2: Stateless Sub-Agents** (Our Approach)
- Workflow Executor starts **fresh each time**
- No history accumulation
- MCP tools provide state instead

**Strategy 3: Explicit Context Reset**
```python
# After completing workflow
llm_client.reset_conversation()  # Clear history
```

**Result**: Workflow Executor sub-agent has **ZERO history** (always fresh context)

---

## Type 4: RAG Context (MCP Retrieved)

### Definition
**RAG context** is dynamically retrieved content from semantic search over Agent OS standards. This is what MCP tools return.

### Characteristics

| Property | Value | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Frequency** | On-demand (tool call) | $ Targeted cost |
| **Persistence** | Single call | Then discarded |
| **Size** | 1K-5K tokens | Controlled |
| **Purpose** | Relevant knowledge | Precision info |
| **Optimization Priority** | **MEDIUM** | Already optimized |

### How RAG Works in Agent OS

```
User: "What are Python's concurrency primitives?"
  ↓
Main Agent calls: search_standards("Python concurrency primitives", n=3)
  ↓
MCP Server:
  1. Semantic search over .agent-os/standards/
  2. Retrieve top 3 chunks (~500 tokens each)
  3. Return ~1,500 tokens of relevant content
  ↓
Main Agent receives 3 chunks
  ↓
Agent responds using RAG context
```

### Token Cost Analysis

**Without RAG** (direct file reading):
```
Read entire file: 15,000 tokens
Use ~500 tokens of relevant content
Waste: 14,500 tokens (97% waste)
Cost: $0.045 per query
```

**With RAG** (MCP semantic search):
```
Query: 50 tokens
Retrieve 3 chunks: 1,500 tokens (relevant only)
Waste: 0 tokens (0% waste)
Cost: $0.0045 per query (10x cheaper)
```

**Annual Savings** (10,000 queries):
```
Without RAG: $450
With RAG: $45
SAVINGS: $405 (90% reduction)
```

### MCP RAG Is Already Optimized

**Built-in Optimization**:
1. ✅ Semantic search (only relevant content)
2. ✅ Chunking (500-1000 token chunks)
3. ✅ Top-K retrieval (3-5 results, not all)
4. ✅ Context reduction (50KB → 5KB = 90%)

**No Further Optimization Needed**: RAG is the optimization.

## Agent OS File Types Comparison

### File Type 1: Workflow Files (.agent-os/workflows/)

**Purpose**: Phase-gated execution instructions for structured tasks

**Characteristics**:
- Size: ≤100 lines per file (optimized for attention)
- Frequency: Read 1-5 times per phase (via MCP)
- Token cost: ~500-1000 per file
- Optimization: Command language (3.4x compression)

**Access Method**: Via MCP tools
```python
get_current_phase(session_id)  # Returns ONLY current phase
# NOT: read_file(".agent-os/workflows/...")
```

**Token Impact**:
```
Phase 1: Read 3 files × 500 tokens = 1,500 tokens
Phase 2: Read 2 files × 500 tokens = 1,000 tokens
...
Total per workflow: ~8-12K tokens (manageable)
```

**Why Optimized for ≤100 lines**:
- Attention quality: 95%+ (vs 70% for 500+ lines)
- Success rate: 85%+ (vs 60% for large files)
- Context use: 5-10% (leaves room for other context)

---

### File Type 2: Universal Standards (universal/standards/)

**Purpose**: Timeless CS fundamentals for RAG retrieval

**Characteristics**:
- Size: 200-500 lines (optimized for comprehension)
- Frequency: Never read directly (RAG chunks only)
- Token cost: 0 (never sent whole)
- Optimization: Chunked + semantic search

**Access Method**: Via MCP RAG
```python
search_standards("concurrency race conditions", n=3)
# Returns: 3 chunks × 500 tokens = 1,500 tokens
```

**Token Impact**:
```
Query 1: 3 chunks × 500 = 1,500 tokens
Query 2: 5 chunks × 500 = 2,500 tokens
Query 3: 3 chunks × 500 = 1,500 tokens

Total: ~5,500 tokens (vs 50K+ if reading all files)
```

**Why Not Optimized for Small Files**:
- Never read whole (RAG chunks instead)
- Larger files = better semantic context
- 200-500 lines is optimal for human comprehension

---

### File Type 3: Language-Specific Standards (.agent-os/standards/development/)

**Purpose**: Generated guidance for specific language/project

**Characteristics**:
- Size: 200-500 lines (generated once)
- Frequency: Never read directly (RAG chunks only)
- Token cost: 0 (chunked for RAG)
- Optimization: Same as universal standards

**Access Method**: Via MCP RAG (same as universal)

---

### File Type 4: Usage Documentation (.agent-os/usage/)

**Purpose**: How to use Agent OS (specs, operating model, MCP guide)

**Characteristics**:
- Size: 200-400 lines
- Frequency: Rare (RAG only)
- Token cost: 0 (chunked)
- Optimization: Same as standards

**Access Method**: Via MCP RAG

---

### Complete Workflow (8 Phases)

| Call | System | User | History | RAG | Total | Cost |
|------|--------|------|---------|-----|-------|------|
| 1 | 800 | 100 | 0 | 0 | 900 | $0.003 |
| 2 | 800 | 0 | 400 | 1,000 | 2,200 | $0.007 |

| 7 | 800 | 0 | 6,000 | 1,500 | 8,300 | $0.025 |
| 8 | 800 | 0 | 7,500 | 2,000 | 10,300 | $0.031 |
| **Total** | **6,400** | **100** | **25,800** | **11,500** | **43,800** | **$0.131** |

### Token Distribution

```
System Prompts: 6,400 tokens (15%)   ← Optimization target
User Prompt:    100 tokens (0.2%)    ← No optimization needed
History:        25,800 tokens (59%)  ← Managed automatically
RAG Context:    11,500 tokens (26%)  ← Already optimized

Total: 43,800 tokens
Cost: $0.131 per workflow execution
```

---

## Key Insights

### 1. System Prompt Multiplier Effect

**Small system prompt** (800 tokens):
```
8 API calls × 800 = 6,400 tokens
```

**Large system prompt** (3,500 tokens):
```
8 API calls × 3,500 = 28,000 tokens
Difference: +21,600 tokens (+$0.065 per workflow)
```

**Takeaway**: System prompt size multiplies by number of API calls.  
**Priority**: HIGH - Optimize system prompts aggressively

---

### 2. History Dominance

History grows to **59% of total tokens** by end of workflow.

**Can't optimize**: LLM providers manage this automatically.

**Can avoid**: Use stateless sub-agents (our approach)

---

### 3. RAG Efficiency

RAG retrieves **only relevant content** (11,500 tokens).

**Without RAG** (reading all files):
```
8 workflow files × 500 = 4,000 tokens (similar)
But also need standards: +50,000 tokens (disaster)
Total without RAG: ~54,000 tokens vs 11,500 with RAG
```

**Savings**: 79% token reduction from RAG

---

### 4. Workflow File Optimization Impact

**Current** (≤100 lines, command language):
```
Phase file: ~500 tokens
8 phases: ~4,000 tokens
```

**Without optimization** (natural language, 300+ lines):
```
Phase file: ~2,000 tokens
8 phases: ~16,000 tokens
```

**Savings**: 75% token reduction from workflow optimization

---

## Optimization Priority Matrix

| Prompt Type | Token Impact | Multiplier | Priority | Optimization Method |
|-------------|--------------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| **System Prompt** | Medium-High | High (×N calls) | **🔴 CRITICAL** | Command language, compress |
| **Workflow Files** | Medium | Medium (×phases) | **🟡 HIGH** | ≤100 lines, commands (done) |
| **RAG Context** | Medium | Low (on-demand) | **🟢 LOW** | Already optimized |
| **User Prompt** | Low | None (one-time) | **⚪ NONE** | User controlled |
| **History** | High | Low (auto-managed) | **🟢 LOW** | Stateless sub-agents |

---

## Conclusion

### Key Takeaways

1. **System prompts multiply** by API call count → HIGH priority for optimization
2. **Workflow files** already optimized (≤100 lines, command language) → DONE
3. **RAG** already provides 90% context reduction → DONE
4. **User prompts** are negligible → IGNORE
5. **History** is managed automatically → USE stateless sub-agents

### The Big Win

**Optimize system prompts from 3,500 → 800 tokens = 77% cost reduction**

This is the **single biggest optimization** we can make right now.

### Implementation Plan

1. Refactor `workflow-executor-persona.md` to 800 tokens
2. Test compliance rates (target: 95%+)
3. If compliance drops, add back critical sections
4. Measure actual token usage in production
5. Iterate based on data

**Next Step**: Create the optimized 800-token Workflow Executor system prompt.
