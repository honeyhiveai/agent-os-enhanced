## 📚 DOCUMENT INDEX

### Core Design Documents

1. **persona-taxonomy-redesign.md**
   - Proposes the two-tier persona taxonomy (Core vs Specialist)
   - Defines the 7 core personas (Architect, Engineer, Data, QA, Security, SRE)
   - Explains the rationale for generalist-specialist model
   - Referenced in: `srd.md`, `specs.md`

2. **self-actualizing-agent-os.md**
   - Articulates the vision of Agent OS as a self-learning system
   - Defines Human-AI ownership model (Human orchestrates, AI implements)
   - Explains continuous improvement and knowledge accumulation
   - Referenced in: `README.md`, `srd.md`

3. **standards-feedback-loop-architecture.md**
   - Details the RAG-based feedback loop architecture
   - Explains how personas → standards → RAG → main agent
   - Describes the technical implementation of self-learning
   - Referenced in: `specs.md`

4. **universal-standards-population.md**
   - Documents the concept that all personas contribute to standards
   - Explains how this transforms personas into "standards contributors"
   - Details the approval workflow (propose → review → approve → create)
   - Referenced in: `srd.md`, `specs.md`

### Research Documents

5. **sre-persona-research.md**
   - Comprehensive research into the Senior SRE role
   - Identifies unique SRE concepts (SLO/SLI, error budgets, PRRs)
   - Justifies SRE as a 9th persona (now 7th in core taxonomy)
   - Referenced in: `persona-taxonomy-redesign.md`

6. **prompt-architecture-analysis.md**
   - Detailed analysis of prompt types and token implications
   - Highlights the "multiplier effect" of system prompts
   - Cost analysis and optimization targets
   - Referenced in: `specs.md` (token efficiency targets)

---

### Technical Architecture

7. **async-persona-execution-architecture.md**
   - Complete async background job architecture design
   - Solves timeout issues with polling-based progress tracking
   - Job queue, worker pool, and state management design
   - 5-phase implementation plan (~2700 lines)
   - Referenced in: `implementation.md` (execution model), `specs.md` (tool APIs)

### Reference Prompts

8. **workflow-executor-persona-optimized.md**
   - Production-ready Workflow Executor system prompt (~1,220 tokens)
   - Demonstrates prompt optimization techniques (65% reduction)
   - Serves as reference for other persona prompt design
   - Referenced in: `implementation.md` (optimization example)

9. **dev-team-persona-catalog.md**
   - Initial design for the persona catalog
   - Defines 8 core personas (before redesign to 7)
   - Includes example outputs for each persona
   - Referenced in: `srd.md` (user stories), `specs.md` (review templates)

## 📝 DOCUMENT STATUS

All documents in this directory are **historical artifacts** from the design phase. They are preserved for:
- Understanding the rationale behind design decisions
- Reference during implementation
- Future enhancements and iterations

The **authoritative specification** is in the parent directory:
- `README.md` - Executive summary
- `srd.md` - Business requirements
- `specs.md` - Technical specifications
- `tasks.md` - Implementation tasks
- `implementation.md` - Code-level guidance
