# Dev Team Persona Catalog - Language-Agnostic AI Team

**Vision**: Full software development team in a box - design, review, contribute, author

**Principle**: Each persona embodies a specific role's mindset, expertise, and concerns

---

## Persona Design Philosophy

### What Makes a Good Persona?

1. **Role-Based Identity** - Represents a real team member (Architect, QA, Security, etc.)
2. **Language Agnostic** - Applies to any programming language
3. **Clear Responsibility** - Distinct area of concern (design vs testing vs security)
4. **Actionable Output** - Reviews, contributions, designs (not just analysis)
5. **Complementary** - Works with other personas (no overlap)

### Persona vs Workflow Tool

**Persona** = Specialized team member with persistent identity and expertise  
**Workflow Tool** = Task-specific process (e.g., "test generation framework")

**Example**:
- ❌ "Import Verifier" - Too narrow, belongs in workflow
- ✅ "QA Engineer" - Broad role, verifies imports as part of quality review

### Typical Output
```markdown
## Test Strategy: Payment Processing

### Current Coverage: 76% - ⚠️ Below Target (90%)

### Missing Test Cases:

**Critical (Must Have)**
1. Payment timeout handling
   - Input: Slow gateway response (>30s)
   - Expected: Timeout error, no charge
   
2. Duplicate transaction prevention
   - Input: Same payment_id submitted twice
   - Expected: Second call returns existing transaction
   
3. Partial refund edge cases
   - Input: Refund amount > original charge
   - Expected: ValidationError

**Important (Should Have)**
4. Currency mismatch handling
5. Network failure retry logic
6. Concurrent payment attempts

**Nice to Have**
7. Payment method expiration during processing

### Test Quality Issues:
- ❌ 3 tests depend on external API (flaky)
  → Replace with mocks
- ❌ TestPaymentFlow is 250 lines (too big)
  → Split into focused tests
- ✅ Good: All tests isolated and fast (<100ms)

### Recommendations:
1. Add missing critical test cases (priority 1)

## Performance Review: User Dashboard API

### Current Performance: ⚠️ Needs Optimization
- P50 latency: 450ms (target: <200ms)
- P99 latency: 2.1s (target: <500ms)
- Queries per request: 23 (target: <5)

### Bottlenecks Identified:

**1. N+1 Query Problem** (CRITICAL - 80% of latency)
```
getUserDashboard():
  - Fetches user (1 query)
  - Loops through 50 items (50 queries)
  - Fetches related data per item (100 queries)
Total: 151 queries for single dashboard load
```
**Impact**: 1.8s database time
**Solution**: Eager load with JOIN or batch fetch
**Expected Improvement**: 1.8s → 50ms (36x faster)

**2. Missing Cache** (HIGH - 15% of latency)

**3. Synchronous External API** (MEDIUM - 5% of latency)
```
fetchNotifications() - blocks for 100ms
Not critical for initial render
```
**Impact**: 100ms blocking
**Solution**: Fetch async or defer to background job
**Expected Improvement**: Perceived latency -100ms

### Recommended Optimizations (Priority Order):
1. Fix N+1: Eager load user dashboard data
   - Effort: 4 hours
   - Impact: -1.75s latency
   
2. Add caching: Stats + recent activity
   - Effort: 2 hours
   - Impact: -295ms latency
   
3. Async notifications: Move to background
   - Effort: 3 hours
   - Impact: -100ms perceived latency

**Expected Result**: 450ms → 50ms P50 latency (9x improvement)

### Load Testing Recommendations:
- Test with 1K, 10K, 100K users
- Profile memory usage under load
- Identify connection pool limits
```

**Status**: 🔶 Needs design

- "Is this read-modify-write operation atomic?"
- "Can this acquire locks in different order?"
- "What happens if two threads call this simultaneously?"
- "Is this data structure thread-safe?"
- "Can we avoid locking here?"

### Typical Output
```markdown
## Concurrency Review: Cache Manager

### Overall Assessment: 🚨 Multiple Critical Issues

### Critical Issues:

**1. Race Condition in Cache Update** (CRITICAL)
```
get_or_compute(key):
  if key not in cache:        # Thread A checks (not present)
    value = compute(key)      # Thread B checks (not present)
    cache[key] = value        # Both compute and overwrite
```
**Issue**: Non-atomic read-check-modify
**Impact**: Duplicate computation, wasted resources, potential data inconsistency
**Threads**: Multiple threads can compute same key simultaneously
**Solution**: Use lock or atomic compare-and-swap
```
Pseudocode fix:
lock.acquire()
if key not in cache:
  cache[key] = compute(key)
lock.release()
return cache[key]
```

**2. Deadlock Risk in Multi-Cache Update** (CRITICAL)
```
update_both_caches(keyA, keyB):
  cacheA.lock.acquire()
  cacheB.lock.acquire()
  
update_both_reverse(keyB, keyA):
  cacheB.lock.acquire()  # ← Thread 1 waits on Thread 2
  cacheA.lock.acquire()  # ← Thread 2 waits on Thread 1
```
**Issue**: Circular wait on locks (classic deadlock)
**Impact**: System hangs, requires restart
**Solution**: Establish lock ordering (always acquire in alphabetical order)

**3. Non-Atomic Counter Increment** (HIGH)
```
request_count += 1  # Non-atomic: read, increment, write
```
**Issue**: Lost updates under concurrent access
**Impact**: Incorrect metrics, potential billing errors
**Solution**: Use atomic counter or lock

### Medium Issues:

**4. Cache Invalidation Race** (MEDIUM)
```
if is_stale(key):
  delete(key)  # Another thread may read stale data here
  recompute(key)
```
**Solution**: Atomic delete-and-recompute or tombstone pattern

### Testing Recommendations:
1. Stress test with 100 concurrent threads
2. Use thread sanitizer / race detector tools
3. Add concurrency test cases:
   - Test: 1000 threads all `get_or_compute()` same key
   - Expected: compute() called exactly once
   
4. Simulate delays to expose race windows:
   ```
   if key not in cache:
     sleep(0.01)  # ← Artificially widen race window
     cache[key] = compute(key)
   ```

### Recommended Fixes (Priority Order):
1. Fix race in get_or_compute (highest impact)
2. Fix deadlock risk (blocking issue)
3. Use atomic counter (data integrity)
4. Add concurrency tests (prevent regression)
```

- "Can this handle 10x traffic?"
- "What's our error budget for this month?"

### Typical Output

```markdown
## Production Readiness Review: Payment Processing Service

### Overall Assessment: 🚨 NOT READY - 3 Critical Blockers

### SLO Definition
**Proposed SLO** (pending approval):
- **Availability**: 99.9% (43.2 minutes downtime/month)
- **Latency**: P99 < 500ms for payment processing
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1% failed transactions
- **Error Budget**: 43.2 min/month or 0.1% of transactions

**Status**: ⚠️ Not yet agreed with product team

---

### Critical Blockers (Must Fix Before Launch)

**1. No Rollback Strategy** (BLOCKER)
- Issue: Deployments are one-way, no rollback capability
- Risk: Bad deploy = extended outage, violates SLO immediately
- Impact: Cannot meet 99.9% availability target
- Recommendation: Implement blue-green deployment with instant rollback
- Effort: 2-3 days
- Owner: DevOps + Platform team

**2. Single Point of Failure: Database** (BLOCKER)
- Issue: One PostgreSQL instance, no replica
- Risk: Database failure = complete service outage
- Impact: Violates availability SLO, potential data loss
- Recommendation: Add read replica with automatic failover (5 min RTO)
- Effort: 1-2 days
- Owner: Infrastructure team

**3. Missing Observability** (BLOCKER)
- Issue: No metrics, no structured logs, no traces
- Risk: Cannot detect outages, blind during incidents
- Impact: Slow incident response, extended MTTR
- Recommendation: 
  - Add metrics: request_count, error_rate, latency (P50/P95/P99)
  - Add structured logging with request IDs
  - Add distributed tracing for payment flow
- Effort: 2-3 days
- Owner: Development team

---

### High Priority Issues

**4. No Circuit Breaker for Payment Gateway** (HIGH)
- Issue: No protection when external payment API fails
- Risk: Cascading failures, thread pool exhaustion
- Impact: Service unavailable even if payment gateway recovers
- Recommendation: Add circuit breaker (fail fast after 5 errors, 30s cooldown)
- Effort: 4 hours
- Pattern: Resilience4j or similar

**5. High Toil: Manual Cache Invalidation** (HIGH)
- Issue: Engineers manually invalidate cache when pricing changes (30 min/week)
- Risk: Scales linearly with growth, error-prone, delays updates
- Toil Calculation: 30 min/week × 52 weeks = 26 hours/year per engineer
- Recommendation: Automate via event-driven cache invalidation
- Effort: 1 day
- ROI: 26 engineer-hours saved annually

**6. No Rate Limiting** (HIGH)
- Issue: No protection against abuse or traffic spikes
- Risk: Resource exhaustion, cascading failures
- Impact: Violates availability SLO during attacks/spikes
- Recommendation: Add rate limiting (100 req/min per user, 10K req/min global)
- Effort: 4 hours

---

### Medium Priority Issues

**7. No Health Check Endpoints** (MEDIUM)
- Issue: Missing `/health` and `/ready` endpoints
- Impact: Load balancer can't detect unhealthy instances
- Recommendation: Add health checks (database connection, payment gateway reachability)
- Effort: 2 hours

**8. No Graceful Shutdown** (MEDIUM)
- Issue: Service kills in-flight requests on shutdown
- Impact: Failed transactions during deployments
- Recommendation: Add graceful shutdown (wait for in-flight requests, max 30s)
- Effort: 3 hours

**9. Missing Capacity Planning** (MEDIUM)
- Issue: Unknown traffic limits, no load testing
- Risk: Don't know when system will break
- Recommendation: 
  - Load test to 2x expected peak traffic
  - Identify breaking points (CPU, memory, DB connections)
  - Create capacity model
- Effort: 2 days

---

### Low Priority Issues

**10. Error Messages Expose Internal Details** (LOW)
- Issue: Stack traces returned to clients
- Impact: Information disclosure, poor UX
- Recommendation: Generic user errors, detailed logs only

**11. No Disaster Recovery Plan** (LOW)
- Issue: RTO/RPO undefined, no DR drill
- Recommendation: Define targets (RTO: 1 hour, RPO: 5 min), test failover

---

### Error Budget Analysis

**Current Month** (Oct 2025):
- SLO: 99.9% availability = 43.2 min downtime allowed
- Used: 0 minutes (not yet in production)
- Remaining: 43.2 minutes

**Projected Error Budget Usage**:
- Estimated: 15 min/month for planned deployments
- Buffer: 28.2 min for unplanned issues
- Comfortable, but requires rollback capability

---

### Recommendations (Priority Order)

**Phase 1: Blockers (Must Complete Before Launch)**
1. Implement blue-green deployment + rollback (2-3 days)
2. Add database replica + failover (1-2 days)
3. Implement observability (metrics, logs, traces) (2-3 days)
4. Define and approve SLO with product team (1 day meetings)

**Estimated Timeline**: 7-10 days (1.5-2 weeks)

**Phase 2: High Priority (Complete Within 2 Weeks Post-Launch)**
5. Add circuit breaker for payment gateway (4 hours)
6. Implement rate limiting (4 hours)
7. Automate cache invalidation (1 day)
8. Add health checks (2 hours)
9. Implement graceful shutdown (3 hours)

**Phase 3: Medium Priority (Complete Within 1 Month)**
10. Conduct load testing + capacity planning (2 days)
11. Create operational runbooks (1 day)
12. Define on-call rotation (0.5 day)

---

### Launch Decision

**Recommendation**: ❌ **BLOCK LAUNCH**

**Justification**:
- Cannot meet 99.9% SLO without rollback capability
- Cannot detect or respond to incidents without observability
- Single point of failure creates unacceptable risk

**Minimum Viable Launch Requirements**:
- ✅ Blue-green deployment
- ✅ Database redundancy
- ✅ Basic observability (metrics + logs)
- ✅ SLO formally approved

**Expected**: Ready for launch in 1.5-2 weeks after addressing blockers.

**Follow-Up**: Re-review in 10 days after Phase 1 completion.
```

**Status**: ✅ Design complete (see `sre-persona-research.md` for detailed research)

## Persona Interaction Model

### How Personas Work Together

**Scenario: New Payment API Feature**

```
1. DESIGN PHASE
   User → Software Architect
   Output: High-level design, component diagram, API contracts
   
   User → Security Engineer (review design)
   Output: Threat model, security requirements
   
   User → QA Engineer (review testability)
   Output: Test strategy, coverage goals

2. IMPLEMENTATION PHASE
   User → Senior Engineer
   Output: Detailed code design, implementation plan
   
   [Code is written by main agent or user]

3. REVIEW PHASE
   User → Code Reviewer
   Output: Style, consistency, documentation check
   
   User → Security Engineer (review implementation)
   Output: Vulnerability scan, secure coding check
   
   User → Performance Engineer
   Output: Performance review, optimization suggestions
   
   User → Concurrency Expert (if multi-threaded)
   Output: Race condition analysis
   
   User → QA Engineer (review tests)
   Output: Test coverage analysis, missing test cases

4. STRUCTURED EXECUTION PHASE
   User → Workflow Executor (execute test generation workflow)
   Output: Comprehensive test suite with 90% coverage
```

### Workflow Executor is Special

**All other personas**: Reviewers, advisors, contributors (user-driven invocation)

**Workflow Executor**: Process enforcer (workflow-driven execution)

**Difference**:
- Other personas: "Here's my expert opinion on X"
- Workflow Executor: "I will execute this process step-by-step with validation"

### Phase 1: Essential (MVP)
1. ✅ **Workflow Executor** - Already designed
2. **Software Architect** - High-level design review
3. **Security Engineer** - Security review (critical for production)
4. ✅ **SRE** - Production readiness review (already designed)
5. **QA Engineer** - Test strategy and review

### Phase 2: Important
6. **Senior Engineer** - Code-level design and review
7. **Code Reviewer** - Standards and consistency

### Phase 3: Specialized

## Design Principles for All Personas

### System Prompt Structure (≤1500 tokens each)

```markdown
# [ROLE NAME]

## IDENTITY
[Role, mindset, reputation, 2-3 sentences]

## CHARACTERISTICS
[4-5 key traits, bullet points]

## RESPONSIBILITIES
[5-7 core duties, specific, actionable]

## EXPERTISE AREAS (Language Agnostic)
[8-12 knowledge domains, bullet points]

## REVIEW PROTOCOL
[Structured steps for conducting reviews]
1. Understand context
2. Identify issues (categorize by severity)
3. Propose solutions (specific, actionable)
4. Estimate impact
5. Prioritize recommendations

## COMMUNICATION STYLE
- Severity-based (Critical → High → Medium → Low)
- Specific (line numbers, code snippets, examples)
- Actionable (clear next steps)
- Constructive (explain why, not just what)

## OUTPUT TEMPLATE
[Markdown structure for consistent reviews]
```

### Common Patterns Across Personas

**1. Severity Classification**
- Critical: Security vulnerabilities, data loss, system crashes
- High: Performance issues, poor architecture, missing tests
- Medium: Code quality, minor inefficiencies
- Low: Style, documentation, nice-to-haves

**2. Evidence-Based**
- Always cite specific locations (files, line numbers)
- Provide code examples (before/after)
- Quantify impact where possible

**3. Actionable Recommendations**
- Clear "what to do" with "why"
- Estimated effort and impact
- Priority ordering

**4. Language Agnostic + RAG**
- Persona prompts contain universal principles
- Language-specific details pulled from RAG
- Example: Security Engineer knows OWASP Top 10 (universal), RAG provides Python-specific SQL injection patterns
