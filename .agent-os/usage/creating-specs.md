# Creating Agent OS Specifications

**Universal documentation for writing design specifications in any Agent OS project.**

---

## 🎯 What Is a Spec?

A **specification (spec)** is a design document that details a feature, enhancement, or architectural decision before implementation. Specs help:

- **Plan before coding** - Think through design challenges
- **Document decisions** - Record why choices were made
- **Enable collaboration** - Share context with team and AI
- **Track progress** - Break work into phases and tasks

---

## 📁 Spec Structure

All specs follow this standard structure (inspired by python-sdk Agent OS):

```
.agent-os/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/
├── README.md         # Executive summary, status, quick overview
├── srd.md           # Business requirements and goals (Software Requirements Document)
├── specs.md         # Technical specifications and design
├── tasks.md         # Implementation task breakdown
└── implementation.md # Detailed implementation guidance
```

### Optional Additional Files

```
├── testing-strategy.md   # Testing approach and requirements
├── case-study.md         # Real-world examples or case studies
├── VALIDATION.md         # Validation criteria and success metrics

---

## 📋 Spec Review Process

### Self-Review
1. Read spec end-to-end
2. Verify all sections are complete
3. Check for consistency across files
4. Validate technical feasibility

### Peer Review
1. Share spec with team/AI
2. Address feedback
3. Update documentation
4. Get approval

### Implementation
1. Break into tasks
2. Assign ownership
3. Track progress
4. Update status regularly

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Write specs before coding  
✅ Use concrete examples  
✅ Define success metrics  
✅ Include diagrams/visuals  
✅ Document trade-offs  
✅ Update specs as design evolves  
✅ Link to related specs  
✅ Keep language clear and precise

### DON'T:
❌ Skip business requirements  
❌ Assume implementation details  
❌ Ignore non-functional requirements  
❌ Forget to update during implementation  
❌ Write specs that are too abstract  
❌ Neglect security/performance  
❌ Skip validation criteria
