## 🚫 OUT OF SCOPE

### Explicitly NOT Included

1. **Autonomous AI Standards Creation**: AI will never create standards without Human approval (by design)

2. **Multi-Project Standards Sharing**: Standards are project-specific, not shared across projects (each project evolves uniquely)

3. **AI Code Execution**: Personas review and propose only, never execute code or commands

4. **Production Operations**: SRE persona reviews designs/implementations, doesn't operate production systems

5. **Workflow Execution**: Workflow Executor persona is separate (already implemented, not part of this spec)

6. **IDE Integration**: Designed for Cursor only, not VS Code/IntelliJ/etc (initial release)

7. **Real-Time Collaboration**: Personas work with individual developers, not real-time team collaboration

8. **Standards Versioning UI**: Standards tracked in Git only, no custom versioning UI

9. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**: Basic metrics only, no fancy dashboards (initial release)

10. **LLM Fine-Tuning**: Uses base models only, no project-specific fine-tuning
