# Phase 3: Meta-Workflow Compliance

**Purpose**: Validate entire workflow against all 5 meta-workflow principles  
**Deliverable**: Compliance report, all violations fixed

**Note**: This is Phase "N+3" in the workflow definition, where N = number of target workflow phases.

---

## Overview

This critical phase audits the created workflow for compliance with all meta-workflow principles. We systematically:

1. **Audit** file sizes across all tasks
2. **Audit** command coverage percentages
3. **Verify** three-tier architecture adherence
4. **Verify** validation gates are complete and parseable
5. **Verify** binding contract exists
6. **Verify** horizontal decomposition applied
7. **Generate** comprehensive compliance report
8. **Fix** any violations discovered
9. **Re-validate** after fixes
10. **Confirm** 100% compliance achieved

**Status**: â¬œ Not Started | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | âœ… Complete

## Validation Gate

ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL**: Phase 3 MUST complete successfully before proceeding to Phase 4.

**Evidence Required**:

| Evidence | Type | Validator | Description |
|----------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `file_size_compliance_percent` | integer | percent_gte_95 | Percentage of task files â‰¤100 lines |
| `command_coverage_percent` | integer | percent_gte_80 | Average command coverage across workflow |
| `three_tier_validated` | boolean | is_true | Three-tier architecture verified |
| `gate_coverage_percent` | integer | percent_gte_100 | Percentage of phases with validation gates |
| `binding_contract_present` | boolean | is_true | Binding contract verified in entry point |
| `violations_fixed` | boolean | is_true | All violations resolved |

**Human Approval**: Not required
