# Task 5: Iterate If Needed

**Phase**: 3 - Discoverability Testing  
**Purpose**: Iterate if discoverability < 80%  
**Depends On**: Task 4  
**Feeds Into**: Phase checkpoint

---

## Objective

Iterate if discoverability < 80%

---

## Context

📊 **CONTEXT**: Iteration ensures quality standards are met before proceeding. Failed discovery must be fixed, not accepted.

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: If pass

proceed to next phase

### Step 2: If fail

identify weak angles

### Step 3: Add keywords/hooks for failed angles

Add keywords/hooks for failed angles

### Step 4: Re-test failed queries

Re-test failed queries

### Step 5: Repeat until >= 80%

Repeat until >= 80%

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Iteration to improve tool-discovery angle

## Expected Output

**Variables to Capture**:
- `iterate_if_needed_complete`: Boolean

---

## Quality Checks

✅ Iteration performed if needed  
✅ Final found rate >= 80%  
✅ Improvements documented
