# Phase 3: Discoverability Testing

**Purpose:** Validate standard is discoverable via natural queries from multiple angles  
**Deliverable:** Discoverability test results showing >= 80% queries found in top 3

---

## Overview

Validate standard is discoverable via natural queries from multiple angles

We systematically:

1. **Generate 5 test queries**
2. **Execute queries against RAG engine**
3. **Measure relevance scores and ranking**
4. **Analyze results**
5. **Iterate if discoverability < 80%**

**Status**: â¬œ Not Started | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | âœ… Complete

## Validation Gate

ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL**: Phase 3 MUST complete successfully before proceeding.

**Evidence Required**:

| Evidence | Type | Validator | Description |
|----------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `queries_tested` | integer | equals_5 | Number of queries tested |
| `queries_found_top3` | integer | greater_than_or_equal_4 | Queries found in top 3 |
| `average_relevance` | float | greater_than_or_equal_0_85 | Average relevance score |
| `average_rank` | float | less_than_or_equal_2_0 | Average rank for found queries |
| `discoverability_passed` | boolean | is_true | Discoverability meets >= 80% threshold |

**Human Approval**: False
