# Task 4: Analyze Results

**Phase**: 3 - Discoverability Testing  
**Purpose**: Analyze results (found in top 3?) and determine pass/fail  
**Depends On**: Task 3  
**Feeds Into**: Task 5

---

## Objective

Analyze results (found in top 3?) and determine pass/fail

---

## Context

📊 **CONTEXT**: Clear pass/fail criteria prevent subjective judgment. If standard fails, iteration is required.

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Review found rate against 80% threshold

Review found rate against 80% threshold

### Step 2: Identify which angles failed (if any)

Identify which angles failed (if any)

### Step 3: Determine if improvements needed

Determine if improvements needed

### Step 4: Document pass/fail decision

Document pass/fail decision

## Examples

### Example 1: Passing analysis (4/5 found)

```
[Example content]
```

### Example 2: Failing analysis (2/5 found)

```
[Example content]
```

## Expected Output

**Variables to Capture**:
- `analyze_results_complete`: Boolean

---

## Quality Checks

✅ Found rate >= 80%  
✅ Failed angles identified  
✅ Clear pass/fail determination
